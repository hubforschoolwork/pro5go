// The error message "setUser is not a function" means that the setUser function is either not being passed correctly to the component or is not defined as a function. This can happen for a few reasons:

// Incorrect Prop Passing: The setUser function might not be passed correctly from the parent component to the child component. Ensure that the parent component (in this case, App.jsx) is passing the setUser function as a prop to the child component (in this case, Login.jsx).

// Incorrect Prop Usage: The child component might not be using the setUser prop correctly. Ensure that the child component is accepting the setUser prop and using it as a function.

// Typo or Naming Issue: There might be a typo or naming issue in the code. Ensure that the prop name is consistent and correctly spelled throughout the code.
