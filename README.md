# Winter Wonderland

- This React app is a forum-style project focusing on the winter season and the activities surrounding this fun time of the year.
- The app allows users to create a username/password.
- The user then lands on the dashboard page and is presented with several categories from which to choose.
- The categories give users the opportunity to ask/answer questions regarding that particular category.
