# Winter Wonderland

- This React app is a forum-style project focusing on the winter season and the activities surrounding this fun time of the year.
- The app allows users to create a username/password.
- The user then lands on the dashboard page and is presented with several categories from which to choose.
- The categories give users the opportunity to ask/answer questions regarding that particular category.


## Future Improvements to the App

This app has definite room for growth and improvement.  It is a good starting point and, with the following suggestions, more depth can be added to the project:
- Add a "regional" feature to the app (i.e., larger metropolitan areas – NYC, LA, San Francisco), so users can discover activities specific to a particular geographic area.
- Add more options to the dashboard sidebar (i.e., specific activity types in addition to categories).
- Add a calendar feature that appears on the dashboard upon login.  This will allow for different events to automatically populate the calendar based on a user’s location/zip code.  Users could add events to their own calendar as well.
- Improve user’s dashboard, so previous user activity can be viewed.
- Add “notification” feature to user’s dashboard, so user can see when a question they posted was answered.  This can be done by alerting a user on their cellphone or showing a list on their dashboard.
- Add user profile functionality.  Once a user creates a username/password, launch a profile page with fields where the user can add more data about themselves, along with a photo, to tailor the experience on the app.
- Make the app functional across all platforms (i.e., laptop, iPad, cellphone).
- With the potential for users of the app to grow, it is recommended that a new database be considered.
